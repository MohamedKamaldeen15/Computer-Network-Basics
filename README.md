1. What is Networking?

Networking is the practice of connecting two or more computing devices such as computers, servers, or smartphones so they can share data, resources, and services these connections can be wired or wireless
wired - Ethernet

- Example: A city-wide network for public services

- Wide Area Network (WAN)

- Range: Covers large geographical areas
- Use: Connecting networks across cities, countries, or continents
